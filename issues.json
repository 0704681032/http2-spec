For example, is it useful for a server to know that a client will issue at most 123 concurrent HTTP request streams?  Or is it useful for a client to know that a server will issue at most 123 concurrent push streams?  If the answer is \"no\", then we can avoid complicating the protocol.\r\n\r\nLimit Values\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition where the client can issue more streams to the server before the server can advertise its accept limit to the client.  Note that a race condition in the reverse path is not possible because a client must issue a SYN_STREAM before the server can push anything, which means it can definitely send the initial SETTINGS frame before emitting the first SYN_STREAM. (And in the future, it will be mandatory for the client to send the SETTINGS frame upon connection)  Furthermore, there is no clear rationale for the value of SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS to “be no smaller than 100”.  To offer clearer requirements, the following is suggested:\r\n\r\nA server MUST be able to handle at least 8 concurrent streams initiated by the client.  A server MUST NOT advertise a value less than 8.  A client MUST generate a session error if it receives a value less than 8 from the server.  The default value emitted by servers is 8.  The default value emitted by clients is 0.  It is recommended that servers pick a much larger value to allow parallelism.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that there is a minimum value so that we don’t fall into a race hole but is large enough so that client is not bottlenecked on RTT for the initial requests.  A default client-side of 0 means the communication defaults to no-push.  That is, a smart client has to proactively advertise a non-zero value for the server to enable push.\r\n"

The current draft specified that request header fields for pushed resources are inherited from the request that triggered the push.  A cache would have to pull details from that original request.\r\n\r\nSince this opens Pandora's box, we might also consider cacheability of other resources when Content-Location and Cache-Control header fields are present."
