This means the server will receive the client's settings before getting the  SYN_STREAM from the client.  However, in the Upgrade Dance the server receives the GET and has to respond with a 101 HTTP/1.1 response followed by the HTTP/2.0 SYN_REPLY.\r\n\r\nThe ugliness here is that the server will be in a situation where it has to send the SYN_REPLY (and possibly DATA frames and possibly start push streams) without knowing the client's settings.  This means the server may blow the client’s flow control buffers, or emit a pushed stream even though the client is incapable of processing pushed streams, etc.\r\n\r\nIf we include the settings as part of the initial Upgrade GET then\r\n1) Server receives the pre-requisite initials settings and the initial GET request in a single package.  Makes life simpler.\r\n2) Brings us to parity with the SSL route where the server will have the cilent's SETTINGS before it starts working on the initial request."

For example, is it useful for a server to know that a client will issue at most 123 concurrent HTTP request streams?  Or is it useful for a client to know that a server will issue at most 123 concurrent push streams?  If the answer is \"no\", then we can avoid complicating the protocol.\r\n\r\nLimit Values\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition where the client can issue more streams to the server before the server can advertise its accept limit to the client.  Note that a race condition in the reverse path is not possible because a client must issue a SYN_STREAM before the server can push anything, which means it can definitely send the initial SETTINGS frame before emitting the first SYN_STREAM. (And in the future, it will be mandatory for the client to send the SETTINGS frame upon connection)  Furthermore, there is no clear rationale for the value of SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS to “be no smaller than 100”.  To offer clearer requirements, the following is suggested:\r\n\r\nA server MUST be able to handle at least 8 concurrent streams initiated by the client.  A server MUST NOT advertise a value less than 8.  A client MUST generate a session error if it receives a value less than 8 from the server.  The default value emitted by servers is 8.  The default value emitted by clients is 0.  It is recommended that servers pick a much larger value to allow parallelism.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that there is a minimum value so that we don’t fall into a race hole but is large enough so that client is not bottlenecked on RTT for the initial requests.  A default client-side of 0 means the communication defaults to no-push.  That is, a smart client has to proactively advertise a non-zero value for the server to enable push.\r\n"

We need to consider how these resources can be cached.\r\n\r\nThis also needs to carefully cover the effect on Vary header fields.  The current draft specified that request header fields for pushed resources are inherited from the request that triggered the push.  A cache would have to pull details from that original request.\r\n\r\nSince this opens Pandora's box, we might also consider cacheability of other resources when Content-Location and Cache-Control header fields are present."
