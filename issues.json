We need to consider how these resources can be cached.\r\n\r\nThis also needs to carefully cover the effect on Vary header fields.  The current draft specified that request header fields for pushed resources are inherited from the request that triggered the push.  A cache would have to pull details from that original request.\r\n\r\nSince this opens Pandora's box, we might also consider cacheability of other resources when Content-Location and Cache-Control header fields are present."
