    "body": "In Firefox, we refuse servers' requests for client certificates if we've done connection coalescing on a connection. This has potential interop issues. For example, Apache can be configured to require a client certificate (via a TLS renegotiation) only upon the first request to some particular paths. This can easily put us in a state where we cannot access such paths:\r\n\r\n1. Browser connects to https://foo.example.org\r\n2. Browser coalesces https://bar.example.org onto that same connection.\r\n3. Browser requests https://foo.example.org/requires-cert.\r\n4. Server requests (demands) client cert\r\n5. Browser refuses to send one.\r\n6. Server returns 401/403/whatever error.\r\n\r\nNote that in theory coalescing could happen before any requests are sent on the connection. Thus, this has the potential to make some client-certificate-required resources completely inaccessible to the client, unless the client retries the request. The client probably won't retry the request, and may not be allowed to if it isn't idempotent.\r\n\r\nBesides the problems with connection coalescing, TLS renegotiation doesn't fit well with browser UI. In particular, it is possible for the server to send a different server cert in a renegotiation than it sent in the initial handshake. It could do this renegotiation even in the middle of a request or response, even in HTTP/1. This problem is even more likely to occur in HTTP/2 because transactions are multiplexed instead of being serialized. The browser thus cannot map requests/responses to certificates in a well-defined way. Yet, usually browsers present server identity in such a way that would make any server certificate change potentially misleading to the user.\r\n\r\nI am sure we can think of many reasons why TLS renegotiation is a bad idea for HTTP servers (of any version). It's probably too late to do anything meaningful about it for HTTP/1 since clients have to deal with existing servers that do it. it would be great to improve things for HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nHowever, because TLS <= 1.2 sends the client certificate in the clear, many implementations (including, IIRC, IIS in its default configuration) do a handshake without a client certificate and then immediately renegotiate to get the client certificate, to protect the client's identity. Thus, we probably cannot prohibit renegotiations that occur at the start of the handshake. A further complication is that TLS False Start interacts poorly with such schemes because the client may send a request on the connection before the server can even request the renegotiation that it intended to occur before any requests were made."

I believe this would make both implementation and interop testing a bit simpler as you wouldn't have to know whether the encoded header block came from a client or a server.\r\n\r\nFor some reasoning behind why this should be ok, in a perfect world most resources that are currently inlined would be sent back to clients as pushed responses. The headers for these pushed requests and response would all be encoded using the server's encoder, and thus using the \"Response\" huffman codes. So these codes should already be chosen so that they efficiently compress both HTTP request and response headers."
