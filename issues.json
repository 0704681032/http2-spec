The replacement of an existing entry with a new entry\r\n    with a size greater than the SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE has the same\r\n    consequences.\r\n\r\nI propose that Indexing new entry with a size greater than SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE must be prohibited.\r\n\r\nThe current wording showing above itself is an already a special case and handling gracefully to try to index entry which does not fit into the header table does not add value.\r\nInstead, without adding extra complexity, we can reject such indexing request by connection error. This is done by just checking the required space for the entry before indexing and emit error if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe relevant discussion was/is:\r\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2013JulSep/0991.html\r\n"

This can be O(n^2) in worst case.\r\n\r\nIf the compressor instead emitted key-value pairs as it processed instructions instead of attempting to build up the entire set of headers, the amount of memory at a forwarding proxy is bounded by the compressor size (with the rest having been emitted onto the wire).\r\nThis also allows maintaining the reference set while processing, removing the potentially costly process of doing it afterwards."

(This isn't critical for -00, or early implementations, but it\r\nwill affect later uptake of the spec.)\r\n\r\nAnd then there are the choices:\r\n\r\n1. The oldest entries are those that get evicted first.  I don't know\r\nwhat the stats say, but this would make it hard to establish a\r\nbaseline set of fields that were unaffected by relatively volatile and\r\ntemporary stuff.  For example, most implementations are going to have\r\nto re-push :method=GET and :method=POST regularly.  It would be good\r\nto understand the trade-off here a little more.\r\n\r\n2. Probably more importantly, you really want the headers that you are\r\nreferencing  most often to be those with the lowest index numbers.\r\nThat means fewer bits on the wire to reference them.  If the headers\r\nthat are most at risk of deletion are also the ones with lowest\r\nnumbers, that doesn't seem conducive to effective use of bits.  I'm\r\ngoing to suggest an inversion of ordering, depending on the above.\r\n\r\nBTW, I do like the linear arrangement, it's simple and it avoids the\r\nneed for updates based on reads from the table, which would suck."
